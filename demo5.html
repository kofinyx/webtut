    <!-- We want to use radio button to select between a dog 
    or a cat.We have to use a "name "attribut to select
    one of them and not both since the radio button will
    allow you to select both with we dont tell it to select
    just one and not both.By given them the same name they
    are connected so we can pick just one and not both .
    We can add a value to tell us what the selection is ie
    dog or cat -->
    <p>Do you prefer cats or dog</p>
